* SlideShow-Simple

** A Implementation of [[slideshow-simple][slideshow-simple]] on Odin!

the objective is to create a slide like structure
that interprete plain .rkt '#lang slideshow/simple'
and that have the habilit to read a custom format,
with the same 'syntax' and semantics, since [[https://github.com/apg/slideshow-simple][SSS]] is so simple (hehe)

the main goal is to be able to generate slides on a simple fashion
without the need to have all the Racket enviropment on machine
but only a single binary or only Odin itself!

since with the second goal is been able to generate plain .pdf
and .epub presentations modes, so is not (a pain in the ass)
dificult to generate a .pdf from Slideshow mode of Racket!


** demos


** motivation
